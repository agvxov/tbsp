# Notes

I stole the idea from here:
[https://github.com/oppiliappan/tbsp](https://github.com/oppiliappan/tbsp)

I firmly believe code generation is the way to go, not just here,
but for DSL-es in general.

I have tried hacking Bison into this behaviour, its too noisy.

This project will heavily depend on tree-sitter,
there is no sense pretending otherwise with decoupling.

### Thinking area
```C
// the symbol prefix should be user changable
```
